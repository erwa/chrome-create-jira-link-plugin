### Create Jira Link

Install it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfjlkhjkfcbcjbkhajogliacgoocfphg

Creates a Jira link in a popup for Jira ticket ids by clicking on them.
Unlike other Jira link plugins, this plugin does not modify the original text; it
instead shows the Jira link in a plugin. Modification of the original text can be
confusing because the user might think all users can see the link, when in reality,
only those who have installed the plugin can see it.

- Configure the Jira server on the extension options page.
- Press Esc or click elsewhere to close the popup.
